- [x] Implement executeProposal() to call TREASURY.executeBatch()
- [x] Write comprehensive tests for NivraTreasury contract

- [ ] Test proposal creation and execution flow end-to-end on local network
- [ ] Fix any ESLint/TypeScript errors after Treasury integration

## Issues Found During Review

- ⚠️ Missing return value check for executeBatch()

## Notes

- Proposal detail page is ~95% complete (all hooks and components connected)
- Treasury contract is implemented but not integrated with Governance
- Recent commits focused on governance optimization and error boundaries

## Deadline
